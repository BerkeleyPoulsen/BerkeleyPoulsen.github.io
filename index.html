                <p>My goal is to be a fully functional UI engineer by the time I leave college.That may mean doing way more than just making a website with one image.Speaking of which, the painting above, as well as about a dozen others can be seen at <span><a href="https://bpoulsen.artstation.com/">bpoulsen.artstation.com.</a></span> Let me know if you have a favorite.</p>

                <h1 class="main_div__resume_block"> 2016 - 2017 Administrative Assistant</h1>
                <p>At Manorcare Potomac nursing home, I answered calls, set up appointments, parsed patient records and had general IT duties.</p>
                <h1 class="main_div__resume_block"> 2017 - 2018 Activities Assistant and Assessment Coordinator</h1>
                <p>My tasks were to conduct assessments of residents and patients, cooridinate their recreational well-being, and perform various clerical tasks we could have trained a monkey to do.</p>
                <h1 class="main_div__resume_block"> 2018 - 2019 Nurse Scheduler</h1>
                <p>My main task was to deal with an elusive population known as "nurses". I negotiated scheduling contracts, resolved scheduling conflicts, and staffed the facility for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Coke was not involved.</p>
                <h1 class="main_div__resume_block"> 2019 - Weekend Scheduler</h1>
                <p>Stockholm syndrome is a condition which causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors during captivity. These alliances result from a bond formed between captor and captives during intimate time together, but they are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims.</p>
